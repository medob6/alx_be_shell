## Description

The **ALX BE SHELL** project introduces you to the **Unix shell**, **command-line interface (CLI)**, and **Bash scripting** — the foundation of system administration and DevOps.  
Through this project, you’ll learn how the shell works, how to interact with your operating system using commands, and how to write scripts to automate tasks efficiently.

This project builds your confidence in working directly with the command line — a key skill for every software engineer.
